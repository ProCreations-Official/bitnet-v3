### Pull Request Process

1. **Create an Issue First**: For major changes, create an issue to discuss the approach
2. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/gakd-optimization` or `fix/mpq-scheduler-bug`
3. **Small PRs**: Keep pull requests focused and manageable
4. **Clear Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
5. **Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Good examples:

**Q: How long does review take?**
A: We aim to respond to all PRs within 48 hours for initial feedback. Complex changes may take longer for thorough review.

**Q: Can I work on multiple issues simultaneously?**
A: Yes, but we recommend focusing on one major feature at a time to avoid conflicts and ensure quality.

**Q: What if my PR doesn't get accepted?**
A: We provide detailed feedback on all submissions. Even if a specific implementation isn't accepted, your ideas and effort are valuable to the project.
